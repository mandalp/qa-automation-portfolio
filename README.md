# 🧪 Cypress QA Portfolio (based on WebDojo)

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

This repository is a **QA Automation portfolio** created to demonstrate
best practices in **Cypress test automation**, using the WebDojo application
as a testing playground.

The focus of this project is:
- Test automation with Cypress
- Clean code and test organization
- Application of testing patterns (Page Object, custom commands, helpers)
- Realistic test scenarios (positive and negative)
- Gherkin / BDD examples for test readability
- API testing and validation using Cypress

## 🧠 What Was Implemented

This repository includes practical examples of:

- Cypress end-to-end tests with clear Arrange / Act / Assert structure
- Page Object pattern for UI abstraction
- Custom Cypress commands
- Dynamic data handling and validations
- Input masking validation (CPF / CNPJ, phone, etc.)
- Radio and checkbox group validation
- Error message validation strategies
- BDD scenarios using Gherkin (feature files)
- Improved test maintainability and scalability
- API tests covering request validation and response assertions
- Integration between API and UI tests when applicable

## 🗂️ Test Data

Some test data and fixtures were intentionally modified or created
to support automated test scenarios and portfolio demonstrations.
These changes are not intended to alter the original business logic
of the application.

## 🙏 Original Project

This project is based on **WebDojo** ([repository Git](https://github.com/ninjadocypress/webdojo)), an application created exclusively
for students of the **Curso Ninja do Cypress**, taught by **Fernando Papito**.

Original repository and credits remain with the author.
This fork is used **only for educational and portfolio purposes**.
